# Compiler Cminus

It was programming homework for the principles and techniques of compilers course in USTC: the main task is to write a compiler for simplified C language, `cminus`. 

I cleaned up the source code so the structure is now better for further development. 

**Compile**

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

**Run**

```
./cminusc ../testcase/gcd.cminus
../testcase/gcd
(input 45 150)
(output 15)
```

For the original project, see [CompilersHomework](https://github.com/regymm/CompilersHomework) (Which is now private. Email me if you need). 

I do not own all these code: some are by my teammates and the teaching assistants.
